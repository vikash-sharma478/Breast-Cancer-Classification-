F1-Score

# 🌟 Key Features
✅ Tackles class imbalance using SMOTE, enhancing generalization on underrepresented cases

✅ Applies robust image augmentation to simulate real-world variations

✅ Implements and compares multiple powerful deep learning models

✅ Provides thorough evaluation with multiple metrics for detailed analysis

✅ Modular code design to allow easy expansion or model switching

# 🔄 Workflow Overview
Data Preparation

Raw histopathology images are resized, normalized, and augmented using real-time transformations.

SMOTE is applied to synthetically balance positive (IDC) and negative (non-IDC) classes.

Model Training

Multiple CNN and Transformer models are trained individually and compared using consistent validation splits.

Class weights and cyclic learning rate schedulers are used for efficient convergence.

Model Evaluation

Final models are evaluated on unseen validation data using F1-score and balanced accuracy.

Predictions are visualized using confusion matrices and probability heatmaps.
